Description: A powerful, generic script that automates the process of publishing a command-line utility to both a Homebrew tap and a Debian APT repository. It is designed to be run from a CI/CD workflow, such as GitHub Actions, and is configured entirely through environment variables.
 This package installs the 'publish-script' script.
